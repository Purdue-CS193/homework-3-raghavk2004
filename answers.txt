Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hey my name is Raghav and I am a student in CS193.

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
The command git fetch will fetch the information from the remote server
and bring this information into my server. In other words it brings the 
information from a repote repository into my local repository.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
In short GitHub allows us to manage Git repositories and is a hosting service. 
On the other hand Git is a distributed version control system. It helps track 
changes in the source code. As a result, GitHub is just a service that allows
us to host and store all of these Git repositories.
