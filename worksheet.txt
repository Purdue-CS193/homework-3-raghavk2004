Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
git add
git commit
git push

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 


Q3: What does 'git status' do?


Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?


Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
You need to run the command git fetch first. 

Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
The code would not be saved since you did not run git push and push the changes yet. 

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
No because you did not push your changes. In order to push your changes you also have to run git push.
